How to quick deploy to GitHub Codespaces:
1. Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
2. Go to https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar.
3. Click the green "Code button and then click "Create Codespace on main".
4. In the terminal on the bottom, paste "npm i && npm run start". (Ctrl + Shift + V)
5. You'll see a popup on the corner about an application. Click "Make public".
6. Go to the ports tab on the top (next to the terminal tab), and then click the website that appears on the list.
7. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run "npm run start".
