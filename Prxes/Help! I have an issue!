"Help! Discord is blocked on my school chromebook and I can't access the proxies!"

I'm sure you know at least one! You probably won't need more that one proxy, anyways.

"But what if it gets banned?"
I guess if it get banned, you would want some backups... but still. You don't need 1000 proxies, do you? 

"Ok, but unfortunately I don't have any unblocked proxies!"
If you actually need some, can't you use another device to access Discord? 

"But I'm only 11 and my parents blocked Discord!"
If you desperately need one, search "school chromebook proxy 2023" up on YouTube and find some there.

"But the word proxy is blocked!"
If the word proxy is blocked, put it in Russian. Worked for me.

"But-"
Shut the hell up.
