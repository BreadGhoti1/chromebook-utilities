How it works
There's an obscure API in most browsers called the Payment Request API. The use purpose is to provide an easy way for websites to make transactions. 
In practice, this means opening a small window containing a website. In short, this weird window messes up the filtering of some extensions.

What it can and can't do:
This only lasts for 3 minutes!
Pages visited in this window will not be saved to your history, but their cookies will be saved.
You can right-click on the window to go back and forward.
There's no good way to make the text in the window larger.
This won't bypass network filters.
You can't log into non-school accounts.
It's completely possible that some filters could read and block the data sent within the window.
